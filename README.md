Severe Weather Chance is calculated using CAPE (Convective Available Potential Energy) and SRH (Storm Relative Helicty). I have future plans to add more models for model compilation and average.

In the meantime the only current supported model is GFS. 

You can see a Day 1 forecast, a Day 3 forecast, or a Day 7 forecast. **(Future plans to add HRRR, NAM, RAP, for short-range models)**

*I am aware of an issue preventing a user from seeing D1, D3, & D7 forecast maps, this will be fixed soon* **:)**
